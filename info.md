#  Design Rationale

The dashboard focuses on Marshall dataset which is the crime data for 68 US cities from 1975-2015 covering four types of violent crimes (homicides, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault),
The following are the utilities used to describe the dataset through various visualization techniques.

##### The header of the function window gives the user a context into what will be analyzed.

##### The slider input takes in a range of the year and then uses that information to plot it on the graph.

##### The paramter radio button takes in a parameter value from a range of values and then uses them on the plot's y-axis. The paramters can range from homicides, rapes, violent crimes and assaults. I wanted this to be a radio button because there can be only one parameter that can be plotted on the y-axis.

##### The select input button can be used to select the city to compare with others. This will then be used to filter out the dataset to include just that city.

##### The `Download results` button can be used by the user to download the data table as a CSV onto their own computer.
